/*Initially sort the given array. And declare a variable to store the minimum difference, and initialize it to INT_MAX. 
Let the variable be min_diff.
Find the subarray of size m such that the difference between the last (maximum in case of sorted) 
and first (minimum in case of sorted) elements of the subarray is minimum.
We will run a loop from 0 to (n-m), where n is the size of the given array and m is the size of the subarray.
We will calculate the maximum difference with the subarray and store it in diff = arr[highest index] â€“ arr[lowest index]
Whenever we get a diff less than the min_diff, we will update the min_diff with diff. */
